## Usage

The MEDYAN executable can to be built from source. Check the [installation guide](docs/manual/installation.md) for more information.

After compilation, MEDYAN can be invoked with additional command line arguments. Use `./medyan -h` to see the help message, which includes all the available commands and options.

To run a simulation with a given system input file, run

```console
./medyan -s <system-input-file> [-i <input-directory>] [-o <output-directory>]
```

The input files are described in detail [here](docs/manual/input-files.md). Example input files for various systems are provided in the `examples` directory. The additional referenced input files are looked up in the same directory as the system input file, unless the `-i` option is used to specify a different directory.

The simulation output is written to the current working directory unless the `-o` option is used to specify a different directory. The output files are described in detail [here](docs/manual/output-files.md).

MEDYAN also comes with a native interactive visualization tool to display simulation trajectories. Run `./medyan gui` to launch MEDYAN in visualization-only mode. In this mode, one can press <kbd>g</kbd> to toggle the GUI overlay.
